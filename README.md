# Sink-a-DotCom

<b>Goal:</b> Sink all the computer's Dot Coms in fewer number of guesses. You're given a rating level based on how well you perform.

<b>Setup:</b> When the game program is launched, the computer places three Dot Coms, randomely, on the virtual 7*7 grid. When that's complete, the game asks for your first guess.

<b>How You Play:<b> <i>NOTE:This is a command-line version and has no GUI in it.</i> The computer will prompt you to enter a guess(a cell), which you'll type at command-line (as "A3","C5",etc). In response to your guess, you'll see a result at the command-line, either "hit","miss", or "You sunk Pets.com" (or whatever the lucky Dot Com to that big 404 in the sky, the game ends by printing out your rating.
